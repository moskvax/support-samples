# support-samples
The "Support v7 Demos" sample app source code from the Android SDK, configured as a gradle project so that it can be easily imported into Android Studio. This source code demonstrates various usages of the classes provided by the [Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html).

All code in this repository has been taken from the `extras/android/support/samples/Support7Demos` subdirectory of the Android SDK, also available [here](https://github.com/android/platform_development/tree/master/samples/Support7Demos). None of it was written by me.
